Generate a one-page synopsis per WTFB requirements.

## Arguments
- `[screenplay-file]` - Optional: Path to screenplay file

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Source
If file not provided:
```
Which screenplay needs a synopsis?

Found:
  1. [screenplay1.fountain]
  2. [screenplay2.fountain]

Or describe your story and I'll format it:
```

### Step 2: Gather Key Information
Read screenplay or gather from user:

```markdown
## SYNOPSIS PREPARATION

**Title**: [title]
**Genre**: [genre]
**Setting**: [location], [time period]
**Page Count**: [pages]

**PROTAGONIST**:
Name and brief description:

**THE CONFLICT**:
What is the central problem?

**THE RESOLUTION**:
How does it end?
```

### Step 3: Apply WTFB Synopsis Criteria

Per WTFB, a good synopsis must:
1. Be easily pitchable by a producer to others
2. Be instantly understandable on first read
3. Give an accurate picture of the story
4. Be one page or less
5. Not over-complicate with every character/detail

### Step 4: Generate Synopsis

Create formatted synopsis document:

```markdown
---
**TITLE**: [TITLE]
**GENRE**: [Genre]
**LOCALE**: [Location]
**CIRCA**: [Time Period]
---

## LOGLINE
[1-2 sentence hook]

## SYNOPSIS

[PROTAGONIST NAME] is [brief character description establishing
their status quo].

When [INCITING INCIDENT], [they] must [GOAL]. But [ANTAGONIST/
OBSTACLE] stands in the way because [motivation].

[Describe the journey through Act Two - the escalation, the
complications, the relationships that develop. Keep it to
2-3 paragraphs maximum.]

### Step 5: Simplicity Test

```markdown
## SIMPLICITY TEST

Could even a busy executive understand this on first read?

**Word Count**: [X] / ~350 target
**Character Names Used**: [count] / 3-4 max
**Subplots Included**: [which ones - should be minimal]

### Assessment
[ ] PASS - Clear and pitchable
[ ] NEEDS TRIM - Too detailed
[ ] NEEDS CLARITY - Confusing elements
```

### Step 6: Producer Pitch Test

```
Imagine a producer reading this, then pitching it in a meeting:

"It's about [protagonist] who [conflict] and [resolution]."

Can they do that from your synopsis?

If not, let's simplify further.
```

### Step 7: Format Options

```
Synopsis complete!

Save as:
  1. Markdown file (synopsis.md)
  2. Add to screenplay title page
  3. Both

Where should I save it?
```
