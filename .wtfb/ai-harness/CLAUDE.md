> **Words To Film By™** harness by J. Scott Graham ([@cheddarfox](https://github.com/cheddarfox)) / [Bybren LLC](https://github.com/bybren-llc)

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with this WTFB creative project.

## Project Overview

This is a **WTFB (Words To Film By)** creative project. Check `.wtfb/project.json` for the project type (screenplay, novel, or film-production).

## Multi-Agent Harness

This project uses an 11-agent team for collaborative development. See `AGENTS.md` for the complete team reference.

### Agents as UX

Writers don't need to learn CLI commands. **Agents handle all tooling via `@wtfb/cli`.**

- When a writer asks to export, the Production Coordinator runs `wtfb export-pdf`
- When a writer asks to validate, the Script Supervisor runs `wtfb validate`

The CLI is infrastructure for agents, not interface for humans.

### Harness Location
- **Agents**: `.claude/agents/` - 11 specialized agent profiles
- **Commands**: `.claude/commands/` - Slash command definitions
- **Skills**: `.claude/skills/` - Knowledge base modules
- **Hooks**: `.claude/hooks/` - Hook configurations

### Agent Invocation
```
Acting as the Story Architect, evaluate the three-act structure...
Acting as the Dialogue Writer, refine the voice for [character]...
```

## Validation

Run validation before commits:
```bash
npm run validate              # Full validation (all linters + capability check)
npm run validate:capabilities # Skill/command compliance only
npm run lint:fountain         # Fountain syntax only (screenplay)
npm run lint:md               # Markdown linting
npm run lint:spell            # Spell check
```

Pre-commit hooks run automatically on staged files.

---

## CI/CD

All PRs are automatically validated for:
- Skill frontmatter compliance (name, wtfbId, description)
- Command format compliance (heading, description)
- Markdown and spelling
- PR title format: `type(scope): description`

Valid PR title types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `chore`, `skill`, `command`, `ci`

Example: `feat(skill): add advanced-structure skill`

---

## Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- `main` - Stable drafts only
- `draft/v1`, `draft/v2` - Major versions
- `scene/[name]` or `chapter/[name]` - Unit-specific work
- `revision/[type]` - Revision passes (dialogue, action, etc.)

### Commit Format
```
type(scope): description

Types: scene, dialogue, action, structure, revision, notes, format, docs
```

Examples:
- `scene(opening): add bar confrontation`
- `dialogue(danny): refine raccoon monologue`
- `revision(continuity): fix timeline inconsistency`

---

## Key Principles

1. **Validate before commit**: Run `/check-format` before pushing
2. **Use branches**: Keep main clean for stable drafts
3. **Track continuity**: Maintain character, timeline, prop consistency
4. **Export often**: Check your work in final format
5. **Protect custom content**: `protectedPaths` in project.json won't be overwritten by template sync

---

## Optional: Marketplace Plugins

**The base template is complete.** All 11 agents, 24 skills, and 30 commands work out of the box. You can start writing immediately with `/start-scene`.

For enhanced workflows (showrunner mode, advanced methodology), you can optionally install marketplace plugins:

```bash
# Screenplay projects
/plugin install wtfb-screenwriting@github.com/bybren-llc/cheddarfox-claude-marketplace/plugins/screenwriting

# Novel projects (when available)
/plugin install wtfb-novel-writing@github.com/bybren-llc/cheddarfox-claude-marketplace/plugins/novel-writing
```

---

## Marketing & Platform Integration

This project integrates with the WTFB platform via `marketing/wtfb-marketing.json`:
- **Commerce**: Digital downloads, merchandise, services
- **Analytics**: PostHog event tracking
- **Funding**: Crowdfunding tiers
- **Rights**: Ownership and licensing info

See the marketing config for details on platform integration.
